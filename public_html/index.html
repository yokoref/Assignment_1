            your one-stop shop for the latest in kitchen items and fresh ingredients, 
            and your source for new and innovative recipes. 
            We enjoy planning and presenting special events for all occasions â€”

            We also offer beautiful baskets overflowing with delicious assortments of casseroles, salads, homemade breads, and desserts; 
            trays of vegetables and cheeses or cookies; 
            or coffee cakes and pastries with fresh ground coffee or specialty teas as perfect gifts for family and friends. 
            We offer seasonal cooking classes in our newly redesigned kitchen for aspiring chefs of all ages.
